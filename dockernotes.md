# Docker Notes

## About

Docker is an open-source platform that automates the deployment of applications inside lightweight, portable containers.

## Features

- **Consistency**: operates the same in various environments
- **Isolation**: each runs independently, reducing conflicts
- **Portability**: "build once, run anywhere" across different environments
- **Efficiency**: containers share the host systemâ€™s kernel and are not burdened with overhead

## Components

### Images

> Templates used to create containers
- e.g. `docker pull <name>` to download the specific image
  
### Containers

> Instances created from Docker images that house the applications
- e.g. `docker run -it <name> /bin/bash` to run the specific container interactively
  
### Docker Daemon

> Runs on the host machine and listens for Docker API requests to manage Docker objects such as images, containers, networks, and volumes.
- e.g. When you want to start a new container with `docker run -d -p 80:80 nginx`, Daemon:
  - Receives the command
  - Fetches the necessary image(if it's not already locally available)
  - Creates the container
  - Manages its lifecycle

### Docker Client

> Allows interactions with the Docker Daemon
  - Primary user interface to Docker 
  - Issue commands to the Docker Daemon
- e.g. `docker ps` lists all currently running containers
  
### Docker Hub

> [Container Image Repository](https://hub.docker.com/) allows users to push and pull container images.

> [Official Images](https://hub.docker.com/search?type=image&image_type=official) provides a vast collection of container images sourced from commercial software vendors, open-source projects, and independent developers. These official images are vetted by Docker for security and performance.

> [Automated Builds](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/builds/) can automatically build container images from source code in an external repository (like GitHub or Bitbucket) and push them to Docker Hub whenever the source code is updated.

> [Webhooks](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/webhooks/) allows triggering actions in other services or toolchains when a new image is pushed to a repository on Docker Hub. This feature is useful for integrating Docker Hub with continuous integration workflows.
